.Display__h1 Background

.Display__p.
  It can sometimes be useful to stop the running of a project at a specific
  point within a step before all of the code has been executed. The reason may 
  be conditional, or it may be that you want to debug a portion of the project 
  without running the rest of it. Whatever the reason, this is the function to 
  use for such a process.

.Display__h1 Basic Usage

:highlight()
  import cauldron as cd

  print('This will appear in the notebook')

  # Stops the execution of the project immediately. Any other steps that
  # would run after this one will be aborted as well.
  cd.project.stop()

  print('This will not appear because it will never run')

.Display__p The stop function can be useful when used conditionally:

:highlight()
  import cauldron as cd
  import pandas as pd

  df = pd.read_csv('example_data.csv')

  # Abort the running the project if the source data frame is empty and there's
  # nothing to process
  if len(df) == 0:
    cd.project.stop()

  cd.shared.df = df
