    +makeBenefitItem('Version-Control Friendly', 'vcs-circle')
      div.
        Your code exists in standard code files. Nothing is mangled by a
        special notebook file format. This makes Cauldron notebooks compatible
        with common version control systems and the excellent tooling around
        them. Code reviews are beneficial for data analysis as well.

    +makeBenefitItem('Production Focused', 'production-circle')
      div.
        Run notebooks in non-interactive mode with Cauldronâ€™s Command Line
        Interface (CLI) or by importing the library into other Python
        programs. Both ways make it easy to run or integrate a Cauldron
        notebook into a production environment.
