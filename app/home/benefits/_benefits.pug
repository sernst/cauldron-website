       div(class='benefits-li__label') Version-Control Friendly
       div(class='benefits-li__text').
         Your code exists in standard code files. Nothing is mangled by a
         special notebook file format. This makes Cauldron notebooks compatible
         with common version control systems and the excellent tooling around
         them. Code reviews are beneficial for data analysis as well.

       div(class='benefits-li__text').
         Run notebooks in non-interactive mode with Cauldronâ€™s Command Line
         Interface (CLI) or by importing the library into other Python
         programs. Both ways make it easy to run or integrate a Cauldron
         notebook into a production environment.
