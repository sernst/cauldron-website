  "description": "\nThe typing module: Support for gradual typing as defined by PEP 484.\n\nAt large scale, the structure of the module is following:\n* Imports and exports, all public names should be explicitly added to __all__.\n* Internal helper functions: these should never be used in code outside this module.\n* _SpecialForm and its instances (special forms): Any, NoReturn, ClassVar, Union, Optional\n* Two classes whose instances can be type arguments in addition to types: ForwardRef and TypeVar\n* The core of internal generics API: _GenericAlias and _VariadicGenericAlias, the latter is\n  currently only used by Tuple and Callable. All subscripted types like X[int], Union[int, str],\n  etc., are instances of either of these classes.\n* The public counterpart of the generics API consists of two classes: Generic and Protocol\n  (the latter is currently private, but will be made public after PEP 544 acceptance).\n* Public helper functions: get_type_hints, overload, cast, no_type_check,\n  no_type_check_decorator.\n* Generic aliases for collections.abc ABCs and few additional protocols.\n* Special types: NewType, NamedTuple, TypedDict (may be added soon).\n* Wrapper submodules for re and io related types.\n"
